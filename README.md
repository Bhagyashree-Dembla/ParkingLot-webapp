# ParkingLot-webapp
The Parking Lot Management System is a Java-based application designed to replicate and manage the complete operation of a parking facility. Business logic is decoupled using object-oriented principles with clearly defined models (such as Vehicle, ParkingSlot, Ticket, etc.) and services (ParkingLotService, BillingService).
